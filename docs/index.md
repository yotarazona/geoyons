My name is Yonatan Tarazona Coronel. I am a PhD student at the University of Coimbra, Portugal. I studied a master's degree in Remote Sensing and Geographical Information Systems at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain. My country is Peru with a background in geographic engineering. 

Since my undergraduate studies, I have shown great interest in two aspects: i) numbers, and ii) how space technology through Remote Sensing is able to record information from the earth's surface.

The idea of collecting information from space without coming into direct contact with it in order to make inventories and monitor our natural resources to prevent their degradation, has led me with great enthusiasm to acquire and increase my skills in the field of satellite remote sensing, as well as my skills in programming languages that complement and reinforce my knowledge, with the aim of achieving a better performance in remote sensing data analysis. *In this career of an insatiable appetite to acquire knowledge*, I was led in a master's degree, which allowed me to improve and consolidate my knowledge and skills in the domain of optical remote sensing, and additionally my beginnings in microwave remote sensing, radar. After having published several research papers in various scientific journals and having developed and published libraries in Python and R as tools for remotely sensed data, I still had the need, the interest and the enthusiasm to start a journey as a PhD student, and here we go.
